my notes for the final and midterm

I have so much to learn.... Hopefully I'll survive

The secure version of HTTP is called Secure Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTPS).  Having a secure connection means that all the data is encrypted using the TLS protocol. TLS is sometimes referred to by a now unsecure predecessor protocol named SSL. 
TLS works by negotiating a shared secret that is then used to encrypt data. Pretty much both devices are communicating with each other and TLS makes it secure.

Web certificates are generated by a trusted 3rd party using public/private key encryption. Using a service like Let's Encrypt, 
and the IETF standard ACME protocol that they pioneered, anyone who owns a domain name, can dynamically 
generate and renew a certificate for free. 

Caddy uses Let's Encrypt to generate a web certificate every time an HTTPS request is made for a domain name 
that Caddy doesn't have a web certificate for. I don't really know what Caddy stands for, but it's what you need to adjust in order to make sure 
that other websites know your website is safe/secure.

Midterm:
  Link element <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> applies styles from styles.css to the page, Links to external resource (usually CSS file) to HTML doccuments. 

  Div tag, Division Tag, Block-level container that groups other elements. usually for structure and layout.

  # = id, unique to just one element. . = class can apply to multiple elements.
